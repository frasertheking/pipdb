Google Colab
------------

An interactive note book is provieded on Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SH-DZ3o8QwG3DI4Vfwv906p190dYkcyV?usp=sharing) to test out the API without having to do any installation/setup steps. 


Local notebook
----------------

We also provide a very similar local version of the Google Colab notebook in the pipdb GitHub repo, which also includes examples for parsing and visualizing multiple years of data at once.
