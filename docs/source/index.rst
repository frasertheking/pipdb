## What is this?

**pipdb** is a simple query API for parsing, visualizing and performing particle size distribution calculations for Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP) data stored on [DeepBlue](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data/concern/data_sets/kk91fm40r?locale=en). For additional details regadring the processing of the DeepBlue data from raw PIP files into NetCDF-4 format, please see the associated GitHub repository: [PIP_Processing](https://github.com/frasertheking/pip_processing).

This project is currently being used for a journal article submitted to AGU's [Earth and Space Science](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/23335084).
