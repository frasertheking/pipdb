Welcome to the pipdb documentation!
===================================

**pipdb**: is a simple library for interacting with Precipitation Imaging Probe datasets, maintained by `Fraser King <https://frasertheking.com/>`

Note that this project is currently under active development.

What is this?
--------

This package is a simple query API for parsing, visualizing and performing particle size distribution calculations for Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP) data stored on `DeepBlue <https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data/concern/data_sets/kk91fm40r?locale=en>`. For additional details regadring the processing of the DeepBlue data from raw PIP files into NetCDF-4 format, please see the associated GitHub repository: `PIP_Processing <https://github.com/frasertheking/pip_processing>`.

This project is currently being used for a journal article submitted to AGU's `Earth and Space Science <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/23335084>`
